### Challenge 
You need to create a new Cloud SQL instance to host the migrated database. Once you have created the new database and configured it, you can then create a database dump of the existing database and import it into Cloud SQL. When the data has been migrated, you will then reconfigure the blog software to use the migrated database.

For this lab, the WordPress site configuration file is located here: /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php.

To sum it all up, your challenge is to migrate the database to Cloud SQL and then reconfigure the application so that it no longer relies on the local MySQL database. Good luck!
