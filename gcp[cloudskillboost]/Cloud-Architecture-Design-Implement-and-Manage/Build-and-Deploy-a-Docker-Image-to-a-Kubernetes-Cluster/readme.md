### Challenge scenario
- Your development team is interested in adopting a containerized microservices approach to application architecture. You need to test a sample application they have provided for you to make sure that that it can be deployed to a Google Kubernetes container. 
- The development group provided a simple Go application called echo-web with a Dockerfile and the associated context that allows you to build a Docker image immediately.



### challenge
- To test the deployment, you need to download the sample application, then build the Docker container image using a tag that allows it to be stored on the Container Registry. 
- Once the image has been built, you'll push it out to the Container Registry before you can deploy it.

With the image prepared you can then create a Kubernetes cluster, then deploy the sample application to the cluster.
